Hi everyone, my name is Pranav! I started coding from the age of 7 when I began marvelling at the wonders you could achieve through programming. My interests leaned towards iOS Development soon enough and I was hooked. I began learning Swift and developing apps for iOS. I thought I could help others with tutorials and tips along my journey. I recently won a WWDC 19 Scholarship too!
